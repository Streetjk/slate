Last known good SHA: `cfd0886da8ef0875b14b271323aff695b59f8003` (Campaign 6B authorization/reporting commit; flashed source remains `bca05819e2cccc5cfdc128d82ffda052b3913412`)
Campaign instructions SHA: `08501bb3ca75739e43fbf4f54811e0243ca5d193`

Current campaign: Campaign 5 — MVP integration/hardening
Current stage: Campaign 6B — post-flash physical and live-account validation checkpoint
Current status: FLASH PASS — boot/read-back evidence captured; physical NOTE4 and interactive OAuth checks remain human-required

Completed campaigns:

- Campaign 0 — Phase 0 baseline: PASS/READY
  - TypeScript, backend, frontend baseline checks passed.
  - Firmware passed with exact local ESP-IDF `v5.5.2`, target `esp32s3`.
  - Native AGY skill and OAuth smoke test passed.
- Campaign 1A — Shared normalized contracts: PASS
  - Shared schemas and deterministic tests passed.
  - AGY medium-effort final review passed with no findings.
- Campaign 1 — English UI: PASS, pending external-review display cleanup recheck
  - Frontend, backend, shared, and NOTE4 firmware presentation/error text was localized to English.
  - Deterministic gates and exact local ESP-IDF `v5.5.2` firmware build passed.
  - AGY medium/high-effort review loop closed with final PASS and no findings.
  - Independent external review later raised XR-005 regarding remaining user-visible Chinese voice/default labels; recheck required.
- Campaign 1 — BTC/USD: PASS, pending external-review hardening recheck
  - BTC current, daily, weekly, and monthly dynamic content integrated with cached backend data, English configuration controls, and deterministic 1bpp renderer tests.
  - Deterministic gates and exact local ESP-IDF `v5.5.2` firmware regression passed.
  - AGY medium review returned PASS with two accepted P3 hardening observations; fixes were re-reviewed with final PASS and no findings.
  - Independent external review later raised XR-001, XR-002 and XR-003; see `CAMPAIGN-INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
- Campaign 2 — Outlook read-only calendar: PASS
  - User-owned Microsoft OAuth/MSAL + PKCE, encrypted token cache, Graph calendarView normalization, Perth agenda rendering, offline fallback, and English connect UI integrated.
  - Deterministic gates passed: 226 backend tests, lint, typecheck, format, Prisma validation, and frontend build.
  - AGY high-effort review passed with no P0-P3 findings. Live Microsoft consent/account smoke test is deferred to the human OAuth boundary.
- Campaign 3A — Gemini OAuth/ADC feasibility: PASS; report published in `03A-GEMINI-OAUTH-FEASIBILITY.md`
  - Official Google documentation verified ADC/OAuth authentication and the required capability split.
  - `gemini-3.7-flash` is selected for text reasoning, Search grounding, structured output, and function calling.
  - `gemini-live-2.5-flash-native-audio` is selected for live audio, transcription, multilingual interaction, Search, and function calling because Gemini 3.7 Flash does not support Live API.
  - Cloud Speech-to-Text V2 `chirp_3` covers the required English and Japanese locales; TTS has an ADC-compatible Google Cloud path.
- Campaign 3B — Gemini voice, Search, and Q&A: PASS; report publication in `03-GEMINI-VOICE-QA.md`
  - ADC-backed text assistant, configurable Gemini Live native-audio gateway, Xiaozhi WebSocket bridge, Opus/PCM conversion, strict tools, and lifecycle/security tests integrated.
  - Deterministic gates passed: 252 backend tests, 6 shared tests, lint, typecheck, format, Prisma validation, and frontend build.
  - AGY medium final re-review passed after a high-effort REVISE cycle fixed seven lifecycle/codec/controller findings. Live Google ADC account and physical NOTE4 tests remain human-boundary actions.
- Campaign 4 — Google Calendar voice writes: PASS; report publication in `04-GOOGLE-CALENDAR-VOICE.md`
  - Google OAuth/PKCE, encrypted user credentials, proposal validation, single-use confirmation tickets, narrow `events.insert`, voice proposal routing, and NOTE4 confirm/cancel UI integrated.
  - Deterministic gates passed: 267 backend tests, 6 shared tests, lint, typecheck, format, Prisma validation, frontend build, and exact ESP-IDF `v5.5.2`/`esp32s3` Docker build with merged artifacts.
  - AGY high-effort review passed with no P0–P2 findings and one deferred P3 ticket-retention observation.
  - Live Google consent/account testing and physical NOTE4 interaction remain human-boundary actions.
- Campaign 5 — MVP integration/hardening: PASS software gate; reports `05-MVP-FINAL.md` and `05-MVP-PRE-HARDWARE.md`
  - XR-002 BTC trio provisioning was implemented; XR-001, XR-003, XR-004, and XR-005 were rechecked as fixed.
  - Final deterministic regression and exact ESP-IDF Docker build passed; final AGY high-effort adversarial review passed with two deferred P3 operational observations.
  - Hardware flashing, physical NOTE4 flows, and live personal OAuth consent remain pending human action.
- Campaign 1B — external-review hardening: PASS; report published in `01B-EXTERNAL-REVIEW-HARDENING.md`
  - XR-001, XR-003, XR-004, and XR-005 were fixed and re-reviewed by AGY with final PASS.
  - XR-002 BTC D/W/M trio provisioning was confirmed as a real UX gap and deferred to MVP hardening with a named “Add BTC Trio” follow-up.

Blocked campaigns:

- None.

Deferred campaigns / required later gates:

- GitHub Actions workflow registration is infrastructure debt; local exact ESP-IDF fallback is the current reproducible firmware path.
- Live Microsoft/Google OAuth consent and physical NOTE4 testing remain future human-boundary actions.
- XR-002 BTC D/W/M automatic trio UX: RESOLVED in Campaign 5 through authenticated trio provisioning and existing frame navigation.
- XR-004 strict per-tool input schemas: RESOLVED in Campaign 4 through static proposal DTO validation and proposal-only voice dispatch.

Active feature branches:

- `feature/english-ui` — PASS; integrated at `eb3c9dbeacf48772b179c6d0d2954fa2120a39ef`
- `feature/btc` — PASS; integrated at `2011ac2c88fcf8c53d12ade1a53269c27b72ee70`
- `feature/external-review-hardening` — PASS; integrated at `5edab3c45e060426fbd0986eac52cf04695d6c0e`

Last test status: PASS — backend tests (270 tests, 0 failures, 845 expectations), shared tests (6 tests, 0 failures, 27 expectations), workspace format/typecheck/lint, frontend build, Prisma validation, secret-pattern scan, exact ESP-IDF 5.5.2/esp32s3 Docker build and merge-bin, artifact hashes, and `git diff --check`.
Last AGY verdict: PASS — Campaign 5 high-effort `gemini-3.7-flash-high` adversarial review; no P0/P1/P2 findings, P3-001 ticket pruning and P3-002 process-local OAuth state deferred, reviewer tree unchanged.

External review gate:

- XR-001 — BTC stale fallback / central freshness policy: FIXED and rechecked.
- XR-002 — D/W/M automatic cached switching UX: FIXED through BTC trio provisioning and rechecked.
- XR-003 — out-of-range Coinbase timestamp normalization: FIXED and rechecked.
- XR-004 — strict per-tool input contracts before Gemini execution: FIXED and rechecked.
- XR-005 — remaining English display labels/defaults: FIXED and rechecked.

Next automatic action: none until the human physical NOTE4 checklist and interactive Microsoft/Google OAuth checks are supplied; then review final release readiness. Do not begin Airtable/Gantt.

Human action required: YES — complete the post-flash physical NOTE4 checklist and perform interactive Microsoft/Google OAuth consent as needed.
